I wrote about feedback
[before](https://www.matanyamos.es/posts/2019-03-03/the-five-pillars-of-feedback/). 
I would like to look at it this time from another angle. This post is going to
be rather short, as I only want to point out the importance of giving and
receiving feedback in all directions around you. Typically feedback is
highlighted in the direction of a manager giving feedback to their report. 

My point is, feedback goes 360 degrees. You should get and receive feedback from
your reports, your peers and your boss. This method is called 360° feedback and
it deserve a long post on its own. Before I write this post, I'd like to live
you with the idea in your mind and let you think for yourself what it should
look like. 

I will cover 360° feedback in future posts.
