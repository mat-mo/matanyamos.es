When you are in a leadership position of any kind, you are focused on the
success of the people you lead. One of the [key
metrics](https://www.matanyamos.es/posts/2019-06-10/measure-or-it-is-not-important/)
that should be tracked is the health and happiness of the people you lead. It is
important as a humane thing to do and it helps with
[Retaining
People](https://www.matanyamos.es/posts/2019-02-10/retaining-people/). 

The question that comes to mind is: How do I achieve this? 

One of the helpful ways to achieve this is by conducting one on one meetings.

## Goals of One on One meetings
I like to think of One on One's (1:1 from now on in this post) as a pulse check.
Basically letting the other person the room to express themselves periodically, 
openly, and privately. The usual flow of a discussion is from
manager, leader, or any person in a position to the people they lead. The 1:1
meeting gives room to reverse this flow, and allows for a more honest
discussion. 

Here are the goals of this meeting as I see them:

* Giving the person you are meeting the feeling they are being heard
* Let the person you are meeting share their situation, in their own words
* Hopefully get some feedback
* Genuinely care for others

## Meeting rules

Now, in order to achieve those novel goals, You must stick to some basic rules.
I covered this bit a little in my post covering [meeting
rules](https://www.matanyamos.es/posts/2019-04-28/effective-meetings/), in the 
section talking about people meetings. I decided 1:1 are so important that they 
deserve a close look. 

In order to save you time, I will sum up the rules mentioned in that post:

* No miss!
* No Agenda on my part
* Be on time, and stick to time
* Listen carefully and take an actionable

### No miss!
The reason no miss is so important, is it gives certainty and clarity to the
question one might ask themselves: when is the next time I can speak to my
manager and get their uninterrupted attention. The predictability is critical!
it [builds trust](https://www.matanyamos.es/posts/2019-03-10/building-trust/)
and removes doubt. A moving target, i.e a meeting that keeps on being
rescheduled also isn't helping in that front. Yes, it actually occurs, but you
can't predict when. Ever rescheduling gives the feeling there is something more
important than the 1:1 meeting, and that is not the message you want to convey. 

### No Agenda on my part
It is not my meeting. It is not intended for me, and it is definitely not a
progress report. Many people tend to turn 1:1 into a progress report. Try
fighting it in the first few times. By clarifying the meeting goal is to give
room for the other person's agenda you basically say: "This is your time, if you
want to spend it on progress report, feel free to do so, but I am not requiring
it, and not expecting it." Usually when you are able to get out of progress
report zone meaningful things come up. 

### Be on time and stick to time
This rule also tries to help with trust. It is basically the equivalent of no
miss applied to showing on time. Showing on time shows respect and appreciation
of one's time. Moreover, it sends a message of priority. If you are constantly
late, it is valid to ask why are you never showing on time. That deserves a
separate post on time management, something for another day.

### Listen carefully and take actionable
The whole point of the meeting is to give space to someone else that is not you.
Try to remain silent, and actively listen. Leaders tend to be very vocal and
suck all the air in a room by their presence. This rule goes against that
habit, and tries to force a change on the typical interaction between a leader
and the person they lead. Since the meeting is led by the other party, and you
might be requested to do things, write them down. Take actionables. Without that
you are disrespecting the other person, that would expect a response or a
followup in the future. If you don't take the action, you will drop the ball,
and that will harm trust, which is the contrary to what we are trying to
achieve.

## Cadence
There are two types of 1:1 - Direct and Skip.

Direct is meeting with people reporting directly to you, or people you have direct
influence on. Skip is meeting with people one level below. In other words,
people that are direct of your directs. I suggest that direct meetings will be
held weekly. The reason for a weekly meeting is the fact people tend to
accumulate things over the work week, and giving space once a week to share that works
well, it might not work best in your case, but from my experience it is a good
balance between too often, and too sparse. 

Skip meetings should be either monthly or quarterly. It depends on the size of
the organization, culture and quality of your directs. Personally I do
quarterly, but your mileage may vary. The same meeting rules from above apply to 
skip meetings but with greater emphasis on the fact you basically want to listen. 
You should remember your skip people might not see you often, and the larger the
organization is, the clearer it should be you only want to spend some quality
time to get to know them better. In some places, being called for a 1:1 with
your managers manager can mean only bad things, try to make it clear things do
not work that way in your organization. 

## Length
This really depends on how you construct your meetings. Some people like to book
an hour, and spend 30 minutes on the other party's agenda, and 30 minutes for
them to do progress report, planning work for next week, and generally focusing
half of the meeting on each parties agenda. I personally don't think this is a
good approach. Combining the two might give the feeling you really care about
your part of the agenda and spend some time on theirs because you feel you
should. It is most likely not the case, but the way things look is sometimes
more important than the actual meeting content. I go for a 30 minutes meeting,
in which I try my best not to enforce any of my open issues. If I have any open
issues, I set a separate, focused meeting, on each open issue I'd like to address. 

Spending 30 minutes, uninterrupted and driven by the other person meeting seems
to me like the best approach, but as I mentioned before, it is more of a
specific preference rather than a rule. All in all, the content and your
attitude are far more important than the time slot you allocated to the meeting. 

## Summary
If you remember that leadership is all about helping others, you will surely be
able to conduct fruitful 1:1's. Being a good listener, humble and friendly
will promise the success of the meeting. Don't forget to follow up on your
actionables.
