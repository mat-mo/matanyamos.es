[Last week](https://www.matanyamos.es/posts/2021-01-19/getting-things-done) I wrote
about getting things done. Today's post is the third post in the Leadership Tuesday series.
I am still focusing on managing yourself, this time on how to take care of
yourself.

Before you can manage anyone else, you have to become really good at managing
yourself. Part of managing yourself is taking good care of yourself. Taking good
care of yourself means each and every level of [Maslow's hierarchy of
needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs).

I personally don't believe it is actually a pyramid, which requires achieving one
level before you can climb to the next one, but rather a several buckets of
needs that should be fulfilled. As this post is not a seminar in psychology, I
will not dive into this subject. My main point here, however, is the fact you
should make sure you handle your needs.

## Basic needs
There is a myth about great leaders, managers and other figures that they "Don't
do X" this is [typically
sleep](https://www.businessinsider.com/successful-people-who-do-not-sleep-2017-7). 
Some don't eat, and some don't rest. Either way, unhealthy. I used to be that
person, I barely slept, and ate very little. I still don't sleep much, and don't
eat much, but much more than I use to. Those are bad habits, and they will ruin
you in the long run. Avoid them as much as you can.

## Your Health
Even if you handle the basic needs and neglect your health, you are not doing
yourself a favor. If something hurts you, don't ignore it, take care of it. Not
only your body will thank you, you will be focused on the task at hand, and not
on your attempts to ignore pain. Moreover, it is a good example to others. When
you need to take care of yourself, show it, so people will know it is higher
priority than any other burning issue they might have at work. 

## Friends and Family
The famous work-life balance. I hate this term. Work is not part of life? Don't
I work on my own things from time to time? For me a better term would be
time-spending balance. As I wrote in the 
[first post](https://www.matanyamos.es/posts/2021-01-12/managing-self) in this series,
nothing can give you more time. Don't neglect your friends and family. I hope it
is obvious why, and I don't want to explain this. 

## Self-esteem & Self-actualization
This two "Self" artifacts, are critical to master before you can lead anyone
else. If you have low self-esteem, why would someone listen to you? Show
confidence, and then people will follow. Feel like you achieved something and
have a vision, and people will follow. You must take care of yourself, before
you can care for others. Handle your needs.

## vacations & time off
Now that we covered the basics, I need to talk a bit about energy. No one should
work 80+ hours a week. It is not healthy, and most likely not useful. But even
if you work 40 hours a week, but never go on vacation, you are never letting
yourself time to let things sink, settle a bit, freshen up. This is true on an
annual basis, but also on the daily level.

Here is an example: Some meetings
suck out all our energy, and we need to re-charge. I think it is totally OK to
plan for this, and if you know you booked something in your calendar that is
going to be an energy sink, book some personal time after that in order to
recover. Every person has their own energy suckers and re-charging habits. For
me, for instance, meeting my team for casual coffee is a great re-charger.
Firing someone, on the other hand is a huge energy sucker. So plan your day,
week, month and year to accommodate your energy needs.

This is all had to say on the subject of managing yourself. I beg you to take
good care of yourself. Next week I will start covering the topic of becoming a leader. 
* P.S: recommendation - read "No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of
Reinvention" Reed Hastings explains things better than I do.
