I hope you came here to discuss leadership. This is a subject very close to my
heart. Apart from talking about leadership I am also a husband, a father, a Wikipedia editor, open source
contributor from time to time, and I am probably other things as well. 

I work for trusteer-IBM as Head of Security research. 

I try to write here somewhat often, but I fail from time to time. 

Most of the subjects here are interesting to me, I hope they are interesting to
you as well.
